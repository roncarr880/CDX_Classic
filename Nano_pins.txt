 "CDX" Radio with Arduino Nano

 use nano +5 for panel power source, feed vin with 8 or 9 volts
 Front panel has Nano, Si5351, OLED display.

Rx audio is the only A/D signal.

AREF  for RX audio level.


Audio Sampling frequency very high at 62500 if use Timer2 interrupt.  Would need to ignore many interrupts.
  1 of 8 interrupts - maybe could spread out CW filtering to a number of interrupts. 
Alternate idea would be to use Timer1 and check the Compare result to see if need to set up Timer1 for transmit. When DIGI TX no longer need to sample Rx Audio in.

Only need timer1 for capture when in DIGI mode TX.
Need Positive or Negative bias for CW mode and/or for low power

With 2 dpdt relays could cover 17 15 and 12 10.  Or any two of 80 40 30 20.  Or maybe 40 and 30 20.

Should the rx be run on 5 volts from a local regulator and have no 7 volts supply.   Or
Should the rx be run on 7 volts and the hct245 run on 5 volts from the Nano. Or
Should the rx be run on 12 volts with dropping resistors and local 5 volts for the hct245.  Or
Should the rx be run on 12 volts with dropping resistors and Nano supplies 5 volts for the hct245.  Or
Should the rx and hc245 run on 5 volts from the Nano.
